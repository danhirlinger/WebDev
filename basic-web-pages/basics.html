    <h1>Internetting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>Here, I am learning how to use HTML!</p>
    <p>If I ever need to search for how to use something,
      Google for “MDN <\some-element> ” </p>
    <p>MDN stands for Mozilla Developer Network</p>
    <!-- use the "a" element to create a hyperlink -->
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Link to MDN</a>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list).</li>
      <li>Add  each item as its own "li" element.</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything.</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same.</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own.</li>
      <li>You should be noticiing these things in a precise order,
        because this is an ordered list.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>,  you need to draw the attention of the reader
      to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize
      the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! I think this HTML stuff is getting  easier...</p>

      CSS soon!  ;)</p>
