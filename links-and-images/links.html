    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
      <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
        target='_blank'> Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
        resource for web developers.</li>
        <!-- target='_blank' specifies to open the link in a new tab/window-->

      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>
        extras page</a>.</li>

        <!-- The below won't work for our local HTML files -->
        <!--
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
        but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
        -->
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the home page of our website,
        but those aren't useful to us right now. This can work when our website
        is hosted on a web server. See this HTML file for the proper syntax.</li>
    </ul>
